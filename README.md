ME 210 Final Project, Winter 2016
Team: Andrew Anderson, Taylor Clayton, Mario Chapa, Sam Hinshelwood
Website: http://me210team72016.weebly.com/

Goal:
The goal of this project is to design, build, and code an autonomous bot
that will pick up tokens from a designated reload station (identifiable by
a 5kHz infrared beacon) and drop them off in at least 3 of 5 drop-off buckets 
located across the stadium (and identifiable each via 1kHz IR beacons). 

Description: 
This file describes a bot equipped with a motor drive board, two DC motors,
ground-facing tape sensors, an IR-signal detection circuit (for recognizing 
1kHz and 5kHz signals), a forward-facing phototransistor, an Arduino Uno, servomotor(s) (for operating the coin-drop-off mechanism), and LEDs for debugging.
